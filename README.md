## What is Information Gathering
Information gathering is the process of collecting data and insights about a target system, organization, or individual to understand its structure, vulnerabilities, and entry points. In cybersecurity, it involves both passive and active techniques to gather as much information as possible, such as network details, domain names, IP addresses, open ports, and system architecture, often used in the early stages of penetration testing or vulnerability assessment. The goal is to identify potential weaknesses without directly interacting with the target systems in a disruptive way.
